# Project Name

I decided to call this project *a Wedding Story*. It is a simple little image gallery app I created for my wife. It tells a short story about us and our wedding, with a heart button to show that you like the image. There are also optional descriptions on the images that can be seen just by clicking on them. I just wanted a nice way to show my wife how much I appreciate everything she does while I am attending my full-stack boot camp at [Prime Digital Academy](https://primeacademy.io/).

## Start Up

If you want to open this app up on your computer, all you need to do is clone down the git repository, and run an `npm install` in the terminal. Then run `npm run server` in one terminal, and then in another terminal in the same directory run `npm run client` to open it in the browser and you're good to go.

### Or check it out on [heroku](https://quiet-fjord-07630.herokuapp.com/)
